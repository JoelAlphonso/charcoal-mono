## Objects

Objects in the `charcoal-attachments` module extends AbstractModel (charcoal-base).

- ***Attachment objects***
	- AbstractAttachment - Attachment Base
	- File
	- Image
	- Text
	- Video

## Widgets

The module provides his own admin widgets namespaced as Charcoal\Admin.

## BUT HOW

The setup is fairly easy, but you need to remember a few things in order for it to work.

### Configurations

Add the views path and metadata path to the config file.
```json
"metadata":{
    "paths":[
        "...",
        "vendor/beneroch/charcoal-attachment/metadata/"
    ]
},
"view": {
    "paths": [
        "...",
        "vendor/beneroch/charcoal-attachment/templates/"
    ]
}
```

Then, we need to add the necessary routes for the widgets in admin.json config file.
```json
"routes":{
    "actions":{
        "join":{
            "ident":"charcoal/admin/action/join",
            "methods":[ "POST" ]
        },
        "add-join":{
            "ident":"charcoal/admin/action/add-join",
            "methods":[ "POST" ]
        },
        "remove-join":{
            "ident":"charcoal/admin/action/remove-join",
            "methods":[ "POST" ]
        }
    }
}
```



### Usage

You need to make your object(s) "Attachment Aware", so that it knows it can have attachments. To do that, use/implement attachmentAware:
```php
use \Charcoal\Attachment\Traits\AttachmentAwareTrait;
use \Charcoal\Attachment\Interfaces\AttachmentAwareInterface;
```

Then, just add in the widget in the edit dashboard or the form like this:
```json
"attachment": {
    "title":{
        "fr":"Documents",
        "en":"Documents"
    },
    "type": "charcoal/admin/widget/attachment",
    "group":"main",
    "attachable_objects":{
        "charcoal/attachment/object/file":{
            "label":{
                "fr":"Document / Fichier",
                "en":"Document / File"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Available attachable objects as provided by the current modile are:

- `charcoal/attachment/object/image`
- `charcoal/attachment/object/file`
- `charcoal/attachment/object/text`
- `charcoal/attachment/object/video`

To create a new attachment, you need to extend the base Attachment object `charcoal/attachment/object/attachment` and provide a "quick" form.

To remove unnecessary join when deleting an object, you need to add this to your object:
```php
public function preDelete()
{
    // AttachmentAwareTrait
    $this->removeJoins();
    return parent::preDelete();
}
```

## Documentation
Attachment widget can be use more than once in a form. In order for it to work properly, you need to define a group ident `group` different for each instanciated widgets.
```json
"attachment": {
    "type": "charcoal/admin/widget/attachment",
    "group":"main"
}
```
In this case, we set the group to "main". If none defined, the default group will be "generic". Without those ident, widgets won't be able to know which attachments are his.

You can than access a perticular "group" attachments calling the object's method "attachments(group_ident)". In this case, `$object->attachments('main')` will return attachments associated with the widgets that has the group set to "main".

## Notes

**Don't use "attachments" method directly in mustache template**. This will return ALL attachments without considering the group.

Custom templates for the attachment preview in the backend widget is on the to-do list.

Other actions such as quick edit and quick view are on the to-do list as well.
