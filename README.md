Charcoal Admin Module
=====================

The standard Charcoal Admin Panel (Backend Dashboard).

# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing charcoal-admin is with **composer**:

```shell
$ composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-admin
```

> Note that charcoal-admin is intended to be run along a `charcoal-app` based project. To start from a boilerplate:
>
> ```shell
> $ composer create-project locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate

# Core concepts

**todo**

# What's inside this module?

Like all Charcoal projects / modules, the main components are:

-	**Autoloader**
	-	_PSR-4_, Provided by Composer.
-	**Config**
	-	As JSON or PHP files in the [config/](config/) directory.
-	**Front Controller**
	-	The admin front controller is handled in the `\Charcoal\Admin\Module` class.
-	**Objects**
	-	Typically  into `\Charcoal\Object\Content` and `\Charcoal\Object\UserData`
	-	Extends `\Charcoal\Model\AbstractModel`, which implements the following interface:
		-	`\Charcoal\Model\ModelInterface`
		-	`\Charcoal\Core\IndexableInterface`
		-	`\Charcoal\Metadata\DescribableInterface`
		-	`\Charcoal\Source\StorableInterface`
		-	`\Charcoal\Validator\ValidatableInterface`
		-	`\Charcaol\View\ViewableInterface`
	-	PHP Models in `src/Charcoal/Boilerplate/`
	-	JSON metadata in `metadata/charcoal/boilerplate/`
-	**Templates**
	-	Templates are specialized Model which acts as View / Controller
	-	Split in `Templates`, `Widgets` and `PropertyInput`
		-	All defined in the `charcoal-base` module
		-	All those classes extend `\Charcoal\Model\AbstractModel`
	-	PHP Models in `src/Charcoal/Boilerplate/Template/`
	-	Mustache views (templates) in `templates/boilerplate/`
	-	Optionnally, templates metadata in `metdata/boilerplate/template/`
-	**Actions**
	-	Actions handle input and provide a response to a request
	-	The PHP classes in `src/Charcoal/Boilerplate/Action`
-	**Assets**
	-	Assets are files required to be on the webserver root
	-	Scripts, in `src/scripts/` and compiled in `www/assets/scripts/`
	-	Styles , with SASS in `src/styles/` and compiled CSS in `www/assets/styles/`
	-	Images, in `www/assets/images/`

## Objects

## Users

Authentication is done through the `Charcoal\Admin\User` class.

# UI Elements

User-Interface Elements, in charcoal-admin (or any other Charcoal modules, in fact), are composed of:

-	A PHP Controller, in _src/Charcoal/Admin/{{type}}/{{ident}}_
-	A mustache templates, in _templates/charcoal/admin/{{type}}/{{ident}}_
-	Optional additional metadata, in _metadata/charcoal/admin/{{type}}/{{ident}}_

There are 3 main types of UI Elements: _Templates_, _Widgets_ and _Property Inputs_.

## Templates

See the [src/Charcoal/Admin/Templates](src/Charcoal/Admin/Template) directory for the list of available Templates in this module. Note that the template views themselves (the mustache templates) are located in [templates/charcoal/admin/template/](templates/charcoal/admin/template/) directory.

In addition to being standard Template Models (controllers), all _Template_ of the admin module also implements the `\Charcoal\Admin\Template` class.

This class provides additional controls to all templates:

-	`has_feedbacks` and `feedbacks`
-	`title`, `subtitle`, `show_title` and `show_subtitle`
-	`auth_required`
	-	Protected, true by default. Set to false for templates that do not require an authenticated admin user.

## Widgets

The following base widgets are available to build the various _admin_ templates:

-	`Dashboard`
-	`Feedbacks`
-	`Form`
-	`FormGroup`
-	`FormProperty`
-	`Graph/Bar`
-	`Graph/Line`
-	`Graph/Pie`
-	Layout
-	MapWidget
-	Table
-	TableProperty

## Property Inputs

Similar to other UI elements, _Inputs_ are specialized widgets that are meant to display a "form element" for a `Property`.

The following property inputs are available  to build forms in the _admin_ module:

-	`Audio`
	-	A special HTML5 widget to record an audio file from the microphone.
-	`Checkbox`
-	`DateTimePicker`
	-	A date-time picker widget.
	-	Requires the ``
-	`File`
	-	A default `<input type="file">` that can be used as a base for all _File_ properties.
-	`Image`
	-	A specialized file input meant for uploading / previewing images.
-	`MapWidget`
	-	A specialized widget to edit a point on a map.
	-	Requires google-map.
-	`Number`
-	`Radio`
-	`Readonly`
-	`Select`
-	`Switch`
	-	A specialized _Checkbox_ meant to be displayed as an on/off switch.
-	`Text`
	-	A default `<input type="text">` that can be used with most property types.
-	`Textarea`
	-	A default `<textarea>` editor that can be used with most textual property types.
-	`Tinymce`
	-	A specialized _Textarea_ wysiwyg editor.
	-	Requires the `tinymce` javascript library.

# Actions

See the [src/Charcoal/Admin/Action/](src/Charcoal/Admin/Action/) directory for the list of availables Actions in this module.

In addition to being standard Action Models (controllers), all _Action_ of the admin module also implements the `\Charcoal\Admin\Action` class.

## Post Actions

-	`admin/login`
-	`admin/object/delete`
-	`admin/object/save`
-	`admin/object/update`
-	`admin/widget/load`
-	`admin/widget/table/inline`
-	`admin/widget/table/inlinue-multi`

## Cli Actions

See the [src/Charcoal/Admin/Action/Cli/](src/Charcoal/Admin/Action/Cli/) directory for the list of all available Cli Actions in this module.

_Cli Actions_ are specialized action meant to be run, interactively, from the Command Line Interface. With the Cli Actions in this module, it becomes quick and easy to manage a Charcoal project directly from a Terminal.

> ðŸ‘‰ The [charcoal-cli](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate/blob/master/charcoal-cli.php) tool, available from `charcoal-project-boilerplate`, is the perfect tool to call the CLI Actions. Make sure it stays outside the document root!

-	`admin/objects`
	-	List the object of a certain `obj-type`.
-	`admin/object/create`
	-	Create a new object (and save it to storage) of a certain `obj-type` according to its metadata's properties.
-	`admin/object/table/alter`
	-	Alter the existing database table of `obj-type` according to its metadata's properties.
-	`admin/object/table/create`
	-	Create the database table for `obj-type` according to its metadata's properties.
-	`admin/user/create`

## API documentation

-	The auto-generated `phpDocumentor` API documentation is available at [https://locomotivemtl.github.io/charcoal-admin/docs/master/](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/charcoal-admin/docs/master/)
-	The auto-generated `apigen` API documentation is available at [https://codedoc.pub/locomotivemtl/charcoal-admin/master/](https://codedoc.pub/locomotivemtl/charcoal-admin/master/index.html)


## Coding style

The Charcoal-Admin module follows the Charcoal coding-style:

-	[_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md), except for
	-	Method names MUST be declared in `snake_case`.
-	[_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md), except for the PSR-1 requirement.q
-	[_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_
-	[_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/)
	-	Add DocBlocks for all classes, methods, and functions;
	-	For type-hinting, use `boolean` (instead of `bool`), `integer` (instead of `int`), `float` (instead of `double` or `real`);
	-	Omit the `@return` tag if the method does not return anything.
-	Naming conventions
	-	Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `grunt phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `grunt phpcbf`.

For Javascript, the following coding style is enforced:

-	**todo**

Every classes, methods and functions should be covered by unit tests. PHP code can be tested with _PHPUnit_ and Javascript code with _QUnit_.
