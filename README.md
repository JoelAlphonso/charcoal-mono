# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing _charcoal-user_ is with **composer**:

```shell
★ composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-user
```

## Dependencies

- PHP 5.6+
    -   This is the last supported version of PHP.
    -   `PHP 7` is also supported (meaning _green on travis_…).
